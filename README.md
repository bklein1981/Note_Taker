  ## Usage
  Note Taker is a simple interface which provides you a title field to title your notes and a text field for the note itself. Once you have entered a title and a note, a save button appears on the nav bar which will allow you to save the note. The note will be saved in the left hand column. You can then recall a note by clicking on it and it will reappear in the right hand column. You can delete any note by clicking on the delete button next to the note.
